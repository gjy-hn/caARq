# The Auslander-Reiten quiver for the companion of path algebra of finite type

A companion of an n-representation finite algebra is introduced in [J. Y.  Guo and Y. Hu, On $n$-hereditary algebras and $n$-slice algebras(ArXiv:2204.06879)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06879). This is an implementation in Python of the algorithm developed from the theory of the paper "J. Y.  Guo and Y. Hu, The companion of  path algebra of finite type" with an excutable file for windows.

Presently it works only for type A. 

To run the program, you need to imput the number of vertices for a quiver of type A and then decide the orientation of each pair of the  vertices of an arrows. The program will produces some tex files in the fold you excute the program. Find the one named "arqq.tex" and compile it with latex, the output will give you the quiver you input, the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the path algebra of your quiver, the quiver of the companion of this path algebra and  the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the companion.
